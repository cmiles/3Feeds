<h2>Only One Feed</h2>
<h4>Single Feed RSS App</h4>
<p>Finding ways to doom scroll, waste time and have your life sucked away by the internet is EASY!</p>
<p>A hard challenge these days is finding ways help yourself get relevant news, information, education and entertainment from the internet without also being tempted by time-wasting clickbait.</p>
<p>This app displays the Titles from a single RSS Feed and opens the item in the browser if you press/click it. That's all it does!</p>
<p>This app might seem pointless - there are already a plenty of more functional RSS Readers that can do this and much more... I wrote this app so that I had somewhere to plug into a 'news' RSS feed and have a single, no distractions, no temptations, spot to check it. The app is deliberately simple/minimal and deliberately boring...</p>

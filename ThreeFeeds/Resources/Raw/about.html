<h2>3Feeds</h2>
<h4>Limited Distraction RSS App</h4>
<p>Finding ways to doom scroll, waste time and have your life sucked away by the internet is EASY!</p>
<p>A difficult challenge these days is finding ways to access news, information, education, and entertainment on the Internet without being tempted by time-wasting clickbait.</p>
<p>This app displays the Titles from a maximum of 3 RSS Feeds and opens the item in the browser if you press/click it. That's all it does! No organizing, no summaries, no marking items read, no distractions, no ads, no suggested articles... And with a maximum of 3 RSS Feeds you can't add 'just one more feed'.</p>
<p>This app might seem pointless - there are already plenty of more functional RSS Readers that can do this and much more. I wrote this app so that I had somewhere to plug into a 'news' RSS feeds and have a single, no distractions, no temptations, way to check-in. The app is deliberately simple/minimal and deliberately boring...</p>
